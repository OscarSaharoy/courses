\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{chout}
	We discuss motivations for studying the mathematics behind machine learning, give an outline of the content of the course, and mention the references which were used in putting it together.

\subsection{Exercises \basic}
\begin{exercise}
	\begin{problem}
	This is the problem statement.
	\end{problem}
	\begin{solution}
		This is the solution.
	\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
	\begin{problem}
	This is the second problem statement.
	\end{problem}
	\begin{solution}
		This is the second solution. What if we have $ x^{2} $.

		What does this look like if the solution is substantially longer than the problem.

		If we have display maths?

		\begin{align*}
			\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{n^{2}}} = \frac{\pi^{2}}{6}
		\end{align*}

		Works as long as the LaTeX is valid!
	\end{solution}
