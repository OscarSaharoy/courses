\chapter{Linear Algebra}
\section{Introduction]

As we look to begin our study of machine learning, we require understanding of some certain mathematical machinery. We shall begin with a study of linear algebra. 
Linear algebra is the study of vectors and the rules we use to change and combine them. The tools and theorems we shall develop will be vital as we look to build up
our theoretical picture of machine learning. BLAH BLAH BLAH
